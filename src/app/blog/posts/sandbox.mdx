## About Sandbox

Sandbox is Northeastern's premier student-led software consultancy. We build impactful software solutions for researchers, professors, and the broader student community. Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic innovation and practical software implementation.

## Current Project: MFA Digital Transformation

We are currently partnering with the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) Boston to revolutionize their internal processes through complete digitization of their form submission workflow.

### The Challenge

The MFA currently manages paper forms that are physically passed between departments and positions in envelopes, requiring manual tracking of signatures and approvals. This process is time-consuming and prone to delays and errors.

### Our Solution

We're developing a comprehensive digital solution that will:

- Streamline the form submission process
- Enable digital signatures and approvals
- Provide real-time tracking of form status
- Improve interdepartmental communication
- Reduce paper waste and processing time
